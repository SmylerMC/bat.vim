Syntax highlighting for Vim, inspired by the default highlighting of the
[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) command-line tool.

As well as an appealing base theme, this syntax highlighting file has support
for the more specific syntax defined by the following plugins:

- [X] Go ([vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/))
- [ ] Python
